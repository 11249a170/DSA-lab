1.LinearSearch
Aim:To write a program that implements Linear Search to find the position of a given element in a list or array.

Algorithm:
step1:start
step2:Input the array A of size n
step3:Input the elements to search, say key
step4:Set i=0 A loop initializer
step5:Repeat while i<n,do the following
      if A[i] is equal to key,then
      print"Element found at position i"
      stop
      otherwise,increase i by 1
step6:If the loop completed&the element is not found 
      print"Element not found"
step7:Stop

program:
Experiment No:01
